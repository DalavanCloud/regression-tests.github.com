h2. Setup your sharing prefences

p. In "Preferences" -

!mac_sharing_prefs.png!

p. Don't copy mine exactly! Your machine name, and IP address will vary of course.  

h2. Clone your fork to the right place

# cd ~/Sites
# git clone https://github.com/<your_github_id>/regression-tests.github.com.git
# cd regression-tests.github.com
# git checkout -b gh-pages origin/gh-pages

p. Open a browser at https://<your_ip_address>/~<your_login>/regression-tests.github.com.git/index.textile to check it all works so far.

h2.  Homebrew

p. Homebrew is the best package manager on the Mac.  You can "install it":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ and then use it to install Git and Groovy.  After installing it, run these commands:

# brew install git
# brew install groovy
