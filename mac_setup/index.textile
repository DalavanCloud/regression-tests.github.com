2. git clone https://github.com/<your_github_id>/regression-tests.github.com.git
3. cd regression-tests.github.com
4. git checkout -b gh-pages origin/gh-pages

Open a browser at https://<your_ip_address>/~<your_login>/regression-tests.github.com.git/index.textile to check it all works so far.

1. brew install git
2. brew install groovy
